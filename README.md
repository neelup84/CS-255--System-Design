Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The main project work throughout the course was DriverPass, and it noticed that there is a need for better driver training. So many people fail their driving tests at the DMV, and there are few people. So, the driver pass project provides students with access to online practice exams and on-the-road training to better prepare them for driving tests. Driver Pass wants some help in designing a system that can handle these needs. The client drivers pass starting to provide better training to make their customers prepare for the driving test. The Driver pass reached out to us to design a system in the form of a website where the people get the train and pass the driving test and also can book the on-road training.

What did you do particularly well?
This course gave me a better idea to handle analyzing systems and visually representing abstract concepts. The diagram for project two would be  UML class, UMLactivities, sequence, which gives a better idea of the projects. I did my best writing business requirement documents and project one. There are minor fixes in the diagrams that is needed as per the feedback.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I want to improve my  UML class and sequence diagrams for sure. However, as per the instructor feedback, my UML Diagram did show every Actor pointing to the Login Node. So I should fix this and modify the UML diagram.

How did you interpret the user's needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user's needs when designing?
I would start designing the system by thinking from the user's side, and I place myself in the place of the user and imagine some of the best learning websites such as Udemy, Edureka, etc. Then, considering user needs to be guided by my approach to system design: the sequence and activity diagrams to anticipate how each class would be utilized.  Apart from that, I would consider security for the users while using credit or debit cards for their payment methods.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
The iterative design approach is one of the essential lessons that will be useful for any system design to create an app in the future.
